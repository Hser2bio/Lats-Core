### Basics

The meaning of "Lats" > it is the name of the national currency Latvia gave away after joining the economical alliance of the EU (good or bad > not for me to decide).

Lats coin is a PivX fork.

1st 1000 blocks are PoW, the reward is 100 $Lats/block.

1001+ > PoS (staking + masternodes)

---

The main idea is to resurrect Lats in the digital format and put it in the hands of Latvian webmasters.
